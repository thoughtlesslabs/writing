Nobody noticed. Not when they promised us protection for a just a little bit of our privacy. Not when they told us they knew better and we could trust them. Not when we gave up the last of our individuality. We toiled in the shadows of their wealth, fighting each other for scraps; with a smile on our faces for being given the honour. We were all asleep and we did it to ourselves.

Seventy years have passed since the last uprising. We've become lazy to the need for a resistance, for the will of the people to unite in an uprising. Our lips are satiated with drops while we rot from the inside out. But today was a different day.

Today, the winds whisper of a newborn who will change the world. The one that will rekindle our pride and reclaim our individuality. Though I will not live to see the fruits of this uprising, my duty is to the plant the seeds and protect it before it grows. But first, I need to get there.
