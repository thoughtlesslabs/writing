Story Themes

Protagonist starts out in "heaven" or "eden" in his hilltop farm house. And the story of his journey is a descent into "hell" or the city.

He fights along the way to build a group of followers but it's a house of cards. Each follower is gained with a lie. 

A secondary charachter who he befriends early on his journey takes notice of these lies and ends up finding his "eden". His eden is destroyed and in shambles. The secondary character tries to call him out on this but he has already gained too much of a following.

the story ends on a question of truth versus lies and the fact that in the real world the liar can win.
