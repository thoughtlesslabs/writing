Conflict

Belief in self. Convincing the reader that they are a sane person but they will turn out to be a narcisictic, evil, and contemptuous person, hell bent on solving all of their problems by using their belief to gain followers.

The leader of this group will be an anti-hero in the sense that although his gains will be ill gotten, the book will end with a group of followers ushering him into the promised land.

But he will get to this sense of being a bad guy through the choices he makes. He didn't start out as bad, but the belief in a higher power guiding him, will lead to choices that make it impossible for him to consider himself good.

He will be conflited with the sense that he asks good of others but he himself has dark secrets.
