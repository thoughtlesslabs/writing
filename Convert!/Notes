Notes

Even as all the other details fade, the light never dims.

but before my mind knew what was happening I was dressed and my feet were taking me out the door.

Wrapping my shoes to my feet, I turned back to the bed. Samantha was gone. But of course she was, she'd been gone for the last 7 years. I stopped getting ready and stared into the dark, empty house. This house had become a den of memories but I had never seen it for what it really was. It was a trap. A place where the comfort of familiarity masked a growing sadness. My head fell towards the floor as if my neck could no longer support the weight of the past. It was time to go.
