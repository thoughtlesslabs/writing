About the house


"This is where we belong!" Samantha had exclaimed after exploring every inch of the clearing. 

"How do you know?" I questioned, a little uneasy with how quiet it was.

She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. I watched, as her lungs filled with air and a smile crept across her lips. The smile I fell in love with all those years ago still managed to stop my mind from wandering and made my heart beat faster. It had been a few years since I'd seen that smile radiate from her as much as it did now.

"If you pay attention, you'll feel it too."

I didn't, but now was not the time to ruin her fantasy. She turned out to be right of course. By the time we set the first stone my love of our new life here had gripped me. As the house grew, stone by stone, so did my affection for Samantha.
