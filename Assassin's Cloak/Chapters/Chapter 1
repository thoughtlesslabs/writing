Chapter 1

It takes approximately eight minutes and twenty seconds for light travelling from the sun to reach the Earth. Eight minutes for the world to be illuminated; to be carried out of darkness. If the Sun disappeared in an instant, we wouldn’t even know for more than eight minutes. But that eight minutes, the time between darkness and light is where I live. While the world continues to bathe in the hope and optimism of the light, I know how fucked they really are. The darkness isn’t just coming, it’s already here and they don’t even know it.
