Outline:
The protaganist is an assassin who is world class. He works for himself, taking bounties off of a centralized database for hitmen known only as "The Council"

The hits have started getting less high profile, but the money has continued to go up. When the protaganist finds the name of a person from his past life, he doesn't take the job, but hunts them down in order to see why they could be targeted.

He finds out the system has been malfunctioning due to a upgrade error and now he must figure out how to dismantle The Council before they murder too many innocents
